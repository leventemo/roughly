# ROUGHLY

.. is a draft version of a guessing game I'm working on. It's work in progress right now.

TODO:
- [ ] format numbers in scores for floats: no "0.7000000000000002"
- [x] add validation for non-numeric chars & comma for decimal points (Firefox and Safari)
- [ ] check back float on inputB when inputB = starterPlayer: doesn't hide inputA
