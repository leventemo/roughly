selectWinner()
guessA < guessB < correctAnswer: B should win

guessA < correctAnswer << guessB: A should win
guessA << correctAnswer < guessB: B should win
guessA < correctAnswer < guessB (equal differences): both should get the same score

guessB < correctAnswer << guessA: B should win
guessB << correctAnswer < guessA: A should win
guessB < correctAnswer < guessA (equal differences): both should get the same score

guessB < guessA < correctAnswer: A should win

correctAnswer < guessA < guessB: A should win

correctAnswer < guessB < guessA: B should win

guessA === correctAnswer; guessB is something else: A should get double the diffB
guessB === correctAnswer; guessA is something else: B should get double the diffA
